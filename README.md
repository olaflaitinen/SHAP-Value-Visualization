# SHAP Value Visualization for Decision Tree Model

This project demonstrates how to use the [SHAP](https://github.com/slundberg/shap) library to explain the predictions of a simple tree-based model (a decision tree classifier) trained on the Iris dataset. The project is structured with industry best practices, including thorough documentation, unit tests, and CI integration via GitHub Actions.

## Features

- **Data Loading:** Load and preprocess the Iris dataset.
- **Model Training:** Train a decision tree classifier.
- **SHAP Integration:** Compute and visualize SHAP values for model interpretability.
- **Visualization:** Generate summary and dependency plots for SHAP values.
- **Testing:** Unit tests using pytest to ensure code quality.
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions workflow for continuous integration.
- **Documentation:** Comprehensive installation and usage guides.
