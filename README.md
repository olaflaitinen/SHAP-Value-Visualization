# SHAP-Value-Visualization
This project demonstrates how to use the [SHAP](https://github.com/slundberg/shap) library to explain the predictions of a simple tree-based model (a decision tree classifier) trained on the Iris dataset. The project is structured with industry best practices, including thorough documentation, unit tests, and CI integration via GitHub Actions.
